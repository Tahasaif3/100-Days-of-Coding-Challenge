// In Google Chrome, you can open Developer Tools by right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Opt + I (Mac).
// Navigate to the "Sources" Tab:

// Once Developer Tools are open, navigate to the "Sources" tab. This tab displays the source files of the webpage, including your JavaScript files.
// Find the JavaScript File:

// Locate the JavaScript file you want to debug in the file tree on the left side of the "Sources" tab. You may need to expand folders to find the correct file.
// Set a Breakpoint:

// Click on the line number where you want to set the breakpoint. A blue marker will appear indicating that a breakpoint has been set.
// Alternatively, you can right-click on the line number and select "Add breakpoint" from the context menu.
// Trigger the Code Execution:

// Interact with the webpage in a way that triggers the execution of the JavaScript code containing the breakpoint. For example, click a button or perform an action that runs the code.
// Debugging:

// When the code execution reaches the line with the breakpoint, the browser will pause execution, and Developer Tools will switch to the "Debugger" tab.
// In the "Debugger" tab, you can inspect variable values, step through the code line by line using controls like "Step over", "Step into", and "Step out", and see the call stack.
// You can also add additional breakpoints, disable existing breakpoints, and resume code execution.
// Continue Execution:

// Once you've examined the state of the code and made any necessary changes, you can resume code execution by clicking the "Resume script execution" button or pressing F8.
// Remove Breakpoints:

// To remove a breakpoint, simply click on the blue marker on the line number again, and it will be removed.
// Using breakpoints in this manner allows you to pause code execution at specific points, inspect variables, and track the flow of your JavaScript code, making it easier to identify and fix bugs.
